# chrome-extension-duplicate-tab
### The chrome extension is opening a current tab on a new tab with adding **_admin_** to the url.
**In order to use the extension:**
1. Download the application and extract the [zip file](https://github.com/lunev/chrome-extension-duplicate-tab/archive/master.zip).   
1. Go to **_chrome://extensions_**
2. Check **_Developer mode_**
3. Click on **_Load unpacked extensione_** button
4. Choose the extracted folder

Then you'll have the duplicate icon on your chrome bar.
Next version will have options, like adding additional urls to the extension. So you'll have a choice what to add to the current url.
